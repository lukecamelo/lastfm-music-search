# Last.fm Music Search

### What's this?
It's a web application that allows you to look up bands/artists and get a short little bio about them, as well as album covers for their top 3 albums, and their respective playcounts. Just a fun little project I wrote for practice.
### What's it made of?
I built it in react as an exercise in, well, react! I wanted to build a smallish project to wrap my head around the framework.
### Neat, how do I run it?
After cloning the project, `cd` into the directory and enter `npm start` in your console or terminal. You're up and running!
